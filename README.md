## 2019 + 2020: Typescript

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run test` to run unit tests
- `npm run watch` to run unit tests repeatedly (watch for file changes)
- `npm run start` to get the final solutions

## 2021: Go

- `go run ./2021/01` to get the final solutions for day 1

## 2022: Rust

_I don't remember how to run this, you have to find out on your own. Source code lives in `src/year2022/dayXY.rs`_

## 2023: Python

- `python 2023/01.py` to get the finals solutions for day 1

## 2024: Julia

- `julia 2024/01.test.jl` to run the tests for day 1 (which also checks the final solutions)
- `julia 2024/01.jl` to get the final solutions for day 1 (and also measure the performance)
- `for i in {01..08}; do echo "Day $i"; julia 2024/$i.jl; echo; done` to get the final solutions for day 1 to 8

## 2025: Ruby

Use the [Ruby LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp) extension in VS code to run the tests. They also check the final solutions.
- `ruby 2025/01.rb` to get the final solutions for day 1
